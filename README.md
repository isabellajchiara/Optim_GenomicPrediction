# Optim_GenomicPrediction

Here you will find the files required to test genomic prediction models RRBLUP, SVM, RF and ANN.

Each Pipeline file contains the steps to simulate one cycle a genomic selection pipeline using the desired model.

The script for each model has a RD(random) version - slecting a random subset of the training population for use in model training - The script for each model has a SC(stratified clustering) version - using stratified clustering to select a subset of the training population.

Genotype data are contained in the haplotypesSNPs.Rdata file. The corresponding map is contained in the genMapSNPs.Rdata file.

TO RUN THE SIMULATION AND WRITE RESULTS FILES:

Navigate to the RunReplications file
Specify which scenario you'd like to run, and how many replications
Be sure to modify the text in the output file to match the scenario you have run
